# Portfolio
Thank you for stopping by!

I add new things here pretty regularly, so feel free to ask me any questions that you have.

I am full time grad student at Northeastern University in Bioinformatics program. Currently I'm taking Data Mining/Machine Learning and Bioinformatics Computational Methods II, which translates to a lot of data science work witn R/Jupyter and scripting in Perl. For additional practice, I like to write in Java or analyze data from roll playing games with OOP. Please let me know if I can assist you with anything or you see an opportunity to coloborate.

Thanks again, 

  Thadryan J. Sweeney
