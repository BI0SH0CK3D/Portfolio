# Portfolio
Portfolio of Python and Perl code for bioinformatics tasks

Thank you for stopping by!

Right now, the Jupyter Notebooks are the heart of my portfolio as I am studying on DataQuest as my free-time learning activity.

Studies in the future will include more Python, especially for Data Science, and most likely SQL and C++.

If you would like to see more of something specific I welcome your feedback, and am happy to answer any clarifying questions.

Thanks again, 
  Thadryan J. Sweeney
