# Portfolio
Portfolio of Python and Perl code for bioinformatics tasks

Thank you for stopping by!

Right now, the Jupyter Notebooks are the heart of my portfolio as I am studying on DataQuest as my free-time learning activity.

I am also comfortable with Perl as it is the language we use in BIoinformatics classes.

Studies in the future will include more Python, especially for Data Science, and most likely SQL and C++. I am also becoming familiar with Java and Go.

If you would like to see more of something specific I welcome your feedback, and am happy to answer any clarifying questions.

Thanks again, 
  Thadryan J. Sweeney
